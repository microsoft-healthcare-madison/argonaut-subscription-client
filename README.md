# argonaut-subscription-client-host

A .Net Core application to work with the proposed Argonaut Subscription changes.

This system creates channel endpoints, generates subscription requests, listens 
for notifications, and hosts a UI for user interactions (requests, notifications, etc.).


# Usage

- Coming Soon

# Notes
- [Cross-Site Websocket Hijacking](http://www.christian-schneider.net/CrossSiteWebSocketHijacking.html) (CSWSH) is not prevented in this example.
- Authentication is not implemented between the client and the client-host (under consideration).
